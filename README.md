Startup Scoring and Clustering:(https://startupscorecaluculator-3igezacnwdpaxf2v7fkas3.streamlit.app/)

This project evaluates and clusters startups based on multiple performance indicators using a custom scoring system and unsupervised machine learning (KMeans). The goal is to assist incubators or investors in identifying and categorizing startups for funding or mentorship.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

team_experience

market_size_million_usd

monthly_active_users

monthly_burn_rate_inr

funds_raised_inr

valuation_inr

ðŸ§® Scoring Logic:

Each startup is given a Startup Score (0â€“100) based on the weighted contribution of six metrics.

ðŸ”¢ Feature Weights

Feature	Weight

Reasoning Behind Each Weight:

team_experience	(0.15(weight))- A strong founding team with domain experience is crucial for execution and resilience. However, execution must be balanced with other growth signals, hence a moderate weight.

market_size_million_usd	(0.20)-Startups targeting a larger market have higher upside potential. Investors value Total Addressable Market (TAM), so this gets a high weight.

monthly_active_users	(0.20)-	Active user base reflects traction and engagement, which directly signals product-market fit. Startups with growing users are often seen as valuable.

monthly_burn_rate_inr(0.10)-	While burn rate is important for sustainability, a high burn is not always bad if matched with growth. So, it's included but given a lower weight.

funds_raised_inr(0.15)-Fundraising reflects investor confidence, but over-reliance can lead to poor capital efficiency. Hence, a balanced mid-level weight.

valuation_inr(0.20)-Valuation reflects market perception and future potential. It's weighted high, but care should be taken as inflated valuations may not always reflect fundamentals.

Note: The monthly_burn_rate_inr was negated to reward startups with lower burn.

ðŸ¤– Clustering with KMeans:

We used KMeans Clustering (unsupervised learning) to group startups into 4 meaningful segments based on:

Normalized performance features

Startup score


ðŸ§  Cluster Interpretation
Based on the cluster centroids, we manually assigned meaningful labels to the clusters:


0	(Cluster ID) - High traction, well-funded startups(Label)

1 -	Early stage, low burn

2	-Rapid growth but high burn

3	-Low funding, low valuation niche startups
